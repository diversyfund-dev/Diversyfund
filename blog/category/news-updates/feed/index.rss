										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As investors look for different ways to continue to build growth during times of economic uncertainty, some are choosing alternative investments to diversify their portfolios. As 2023 comes to a close, some of the alternative investment trends from throughout the year provide unique options for investors like you. These trends provide a way to diversify without conventional stocks and bonds, adding unique investments to your portfolio while letting you branch out into new businesses and industries. Understanding the different options available to you can make it easier to select alternative investments that align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding Alternative Investments</h2>



<p>Alternative investments are any investments that fall outside of traditional investment categories. Essentially, this means investments that aren’t stocks, bonds, or cash. There are many different types of alternative investments available, such as art, commodities, and even hedge funds. Some may carry more risk when compared to stocks and bonds, while others can be used to hedge against market volatility and inflation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="http://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-02-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-26279" srcset="https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-02-1024x531.png 1024w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-02-300x156.png 300w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-02-768x399.png 768w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-02-1536x797.png 1536w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-02.png 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Real Estate Investments</h2>



<p>For investors looking to diversify and hedge against market volatility, real estate investments can be an attractive option. During times of inflation, real estate can increase in value. Real estate markets tend to be a bit more stable, providing a way to balance out a portfolio that’s heavy in stocks. With inflation continuing to be a problem in some markets, real estate remains a trend for 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investors can look to purchase properties individually, though this can be cost-prohibitive for some. Taking on the expense of purchasing a property and managing it isn’t for everyone, but there are other options available. REITs and single-asset offerings provide investors of all experience levels an easy way to put their money in real estate without having to purchase a property on their own. You can learn more about DiversyFund’s real estate offerings <a href="https://diversyfund.com/offerings/">here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Private Equity</h2>



<p>Private equity firms offer investment funds to institutional and accredited investors. These funds acquire and manage existing companies, both public and private, before selling them off at a potential profit. For individuals, this asset class is typically limited to those with a high net worth due to the amount of capital required to invest. According to recent reporting from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/02/09/the-top-five-alternative-investment-sectors-in-2023/?sh=49a02ebd400f">Forbes</a>, private equity healthcare investments are trending for 2023, with companies making advancements in the study of medicine providing a host of new opportunities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Equity Crowdfunding</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/equity-crowdfunding">Equity crowdfunding</a> is an alternative investment non-accredited investors might find interesting for diversification. Businesses are able to raise capital by issuing investors ownership in their companies. Startups can use equity crowdfunding to get their businesses started or to expand without having to rely on a single angel investor or institutional funding, and individual investors can put their money in ideas they believe in. Non-accredited investors like this alternative to private equity because the minimum investment is significantly lower; the thresholds can be as low as $500, depending on the investment opportunity. With crowdfunding essentially leveling the playing field, it’s a trend to watch for 2023 and beyond. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-03-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-26280" srcset="https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-03-1024x531.png 1024w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-03-300x156.png 300w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-03-768x399.png 768w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-03-1536x797.png 1536w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alternative-investment-trends-2023-03.png 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Venture Capital</h2>



<p>Venture capital is sometimes grouped together with private equity, but it can be looked at as a separate trend for 2023. Venture capitalists put their money in startups and other businesses they feel have a good long-term financial outlet, giving the businesses a needed influx of cash. While venture capital has been around for decades, recent advances in <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/the-role-of-ai-in-venture-capital-evolution-or-replacement#:~:text=AI%20tools%20can%20help%20venture,required%20analytics%20to%20venture%20capitalists.">AI technology</a> have provided potential insight into the probability of failure or success for investments. AI-driven algorithms and data can take the place of hours of research and market analysis on the part of investors and financial advisors. It is important to remember, however, that AI technology is relatively new in the world of finance. The success rate hasn’t been proven, so there’s still no such thing as a sure bet, even with artificial intelligence helping make the decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What it Means for Investors Like You</h2>



<p>Creating a diverse portfolio is essential for investors looking to build long-term growth and weather the storms of market volatility. Alternative investments have long been used to diversify, and the trends for the end of 2023 provide investors like you with plenty of different options. Whether you’re an accredited investor or a non-accredited investor, there’s an alternative investment strategy you can use to help meet your long-term financial goals. As always, you’ll want to consult with your financial advisor before making any significant money moves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>SAN DIEGO (June 9, 2023)</strong> — Pioneering real estate investment platform DiversyFund announced today that one of the company’s funds, DF Growth REIT II, LLC, has reached a final settlement agreement with the SEC regarding the offering of Growth REIT II shares.&nbsp; The SEC alleged that Growth REIT II failed to comply with certain technical requirements of Regulation A and had included inaccurate statements about the fund on its website. None of the SEC’s complaints alleged any intentional wrongdoing or financial or accounting violations, and accurate information about the offering was available to investors at all times. Growth REIT II terminated the offering of its shares in 2022 and the fund will not resume any offering of new shares. The termination of the offering does not affect Growth REIT II’s operation of its existing real estate portfolio and the company will continue to manage its multifamily assets on behalf of its investors. Growth REIT II neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings in its Order. No fines or penalties were administered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“During a time when the fintech industry is being heavily scrutinized, we are grateful to have gone through this experience at an early stage of our growth. We took remedial actions as soon as we learned of the SEC’s concerns and we continue strengthening our internal compliance and control procedures. We remain committed to building a leading online investment platform that allows every investor access to asset classes that have long been barred to most investors,” DiversyFund Co-Founder and CEO Craig Cecilio said.</p>



<p>DiversyFund offers the everyday investor opportunities previously inaccessible to all but the wealthy. Building on the early success of its REITs, or real estate investment trusts, that focused on multifamily real estate, the company has expanded its investment product family with Premier Plan single asset investment offerings like The Independent, a 61 unit multifamily property, and the recent opening of its Opportunity Fund focused on multifamily real estate investments. DiversyFund also expects to launch its fourth REIT in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the foundations of investment strategy is building a diverse portfolio. With so many options, including stocks, bonds, REITs, and CDs, it’s important to know how the investment vehicles you select are expected to perform. Analysts have their thoughts on the 10-year outlook for the stock market, as well as the performance of investments over the last year. Examining these results and predictions can help inform your investment strategy going forward. Here are a few things you might want to take into consideration when looking for ways to build long-term growth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2022 Market Performance at a Glance</h2>



<p>The last year presented investors with some significant market volatility. While ups and downs are always expected, some factors, including inflation, geopolitical uncertainty, and ongoing supply chain disruptions impacted the markets throughout the year. This caused considerable chaos for stock markets, with the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html">S&amp;P 500 down 20%</a> at the end of 2022. Slower growth and existing market conditions may mean that buying low right now might not lead to the same gains investors might typically expect during market rebounds. Bonds also experienced a slump in 2022, and some investors saw significant losses. In fact, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/07/2022-was-the-worst-ever-year-for-us-bonds-how-to-position-for-2023.html#:~:text=The%20index%20lost%20more%20than,back%20using%20different%20bond%20barometers.">U.S. bonds saw a loss of 13%</a>, which was partially due to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes during 2022. Interest rates also impacted real estate markets and other investment markets, providing investors with some challenges when selecting where to put their money.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_02-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-25986" srcset="https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_02-1024x531.png 1024w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_02-300x156.png 300w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_02-768x399.png 768w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_02-1536x797.png 1536w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_02.png 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stock Market Outlook</h2>



<p>While subject to market volatility, the stock market tends to provide higher returns than bonds and other fixed-rate investment vehicles. The current economic climate, with interest rates continuing at higher rates than the previous years, may lead to lower gains for stock market investments. <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/research/market-outlook">JPMorgan’s most recent research</a> indicates a U.S. recession may be likely in 2023, but a global recession is not expected. As a result, foreign stocks may not feel the same impacts and volatility as domestic stocks. However, it’s important to note that changes in the Federal Reserve’s policy, as well as any number of other economic factors, can change the outlook for the stock market and investment markets in general.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bond Market Outlook</h2>



<p>Bonds may not have had a great year in 2022, but they seem to be on the rebound. Risk-free treasuries offer a way to offset stock market losses in a diverse portfolio, and starting yields are currently trending higher than they were in 2022. While bonds bought before the recent interest rate hikes did not perform well, those sold at the higher rates have higher yields and greater promises of return. Government-backed bonds may provide <a href="https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/fixed-income-outlook#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20a%20long,markets%20appear%20poised%20to%20rebound.">yields of 4-5%</a>, which may not be as high as seen with other investments, but they can offer a smart addition to a portfolio.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Real Estate Outlook</h2>



<p>Real estate provides a way to hedge against inflation and market volatility while building a portfolio geared toward long-term growth, and that ideology holds true for 2023 and beyond. While some were worried about a potential bubble burst after such a strong real estate market over the last few years, it would appear so far that those fears were unfounded. Interest rates remain high, but the market is significantly different than it was during the Great Recession. Inventory remains low for new homes, which means there’s still considerable demand for both houses and rental units. Prices for single-family homes are only <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/real-estate/2022/12/15/housing-market-six-experts-2023-real-estate-industry/10881757002/">expected to fall around 4%</a>, keeping prices higher than they were pre-pandemic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_03-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-25987" srcset="https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_03-1024x531.png 1024w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_03-300x156.png 300w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_03-768x399.png 768w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_03-1536x797.png 1536w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_03.png 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Outlook for Other Investments</h2>



<p>Of course, there are other investment options to consider when looking to create a long-term growth strategy. Higher interest rates can positively impact other fixed-interest vehicles, such as CDs. Starting CD ladders, for example, during times of higher inflation can provide another way to hedge against market volatility. The cryptocurrency market saw significant volatility throughout 2022, and predicting its outlook may be difficult. <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/crypto-outlook">Potential for government regulations </a>may offer some options for stabilizing the market, but there’s no clear answer for how crypto will perform in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What it Means for Investors Like You</h2>



<p>Investors looking to build long-term growth may see lower returns on stocks, though foreign stocks may provide more stability should the U.S. see a recession in 2023. Higher interest rates provide the potential for higher returns when investing in bonds and CDs, though the returns may still be lower than stocks. Real estate continues to provide an option for hedging against inflation. Other alternative investments, such as crypto, may be difficult for experts to predict in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="531" src="https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_04-1024x531.png" alt="" class="wp-image-25988" srcset="https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_04-1024x531.png 1024w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_04-300x156.png 300w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_04-768x399.png 768w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_04-1536x797.png 1536w, https://diversyfund.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/a_look_ahead_long_term_growth_markets_04.png 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As always, you should consult with a financial expert before making any decisions about investing. Be sure to discuss all the options available for creating a diverse portfolio and building a successful strategy for long-term growth. <a href="https://diversyfund.com/how-it-works/?utm_source=inbound-content&amp;utm_medium=organic%20growth&amp;campaign_name=blog-post-2-17-2023">DiversyFund</a> offers both REIT funds and single-asset investment options, making it easy to add real estate to your portfolio.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DiversyFund is pleased to announce the first cash dividend distribution to investors in the DF Growth REIT, LLC (REIT I) fund. This initial distribution totals $4 million, and it represents an approximate 6.1% annualized return for REIT I investors. In comparison, in 2022 stocks, bonds, and public real estate funds have returned -9.24%, -12.79%, and -13.26% year to date, respectively.* </p>



<p>We expect to process this dividend by December 31, 2022. You will see this distribution reflected on your dashboard under cash available. Keep in mind, the annualized return represented by this distribution is based on the sale of assets in the portfolio and does not represent the prospective total return for Growth REIT I. The fund is continuing to perform as expected.</p>



<p>The beginning of the pandemic caused a serious downturn in US real estate markets, and REIT I began aggressively purchasing assets from operators looking to liquidate at a fair price. Our strategy is to consistently monitor the real estate market, and in 2022 we noticed the market beginning to peak. Taking advantage of these favorable conditions, DiversyFund decided to market four of our stabilized assets.

<p>REIT I is currently in the middle of its projected 5 to 7-year lifecycle. With this in mind, we have decided to redeploy some capital into additional value-add opportunities while maintaining reserves to better defend against the pending economic cycle by strengthening the fund’s portfolio. Redeployed capital from dispositions was used to acquire interests in two multifamily assets in the Dallas Fort Worth market: Cobble Hill, a 136 unit asset built in 1984 and Village Creek, a 184 unit asset built in 1980. We may acquire an additional 200 units in San Antonio, Texas. The $4 million dollar cash dividend represents just a portion of the expected total return on investments in REIT I.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for your continued support of our vision of providing access to private markets for the retail investor. We’re looking forward to 2023 and beyond and our ability to offer you more exciting investment opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Real estate investors looking for a strong rental market would do well to consider markets with a high price-to-rent (PTR) ratio. The higher the ratio, the higher the demand for rental property. A PTR ratio is useful in determining whether renting or buying a home is a more affordable option for residents of a given area.</p>



<p>Commercial real estate investments platform <a href="https://diversyfund.com/?utm_source=blogs&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;content=price-rent">DiversyFund</a> calculated the 15 cities with the highest PTR ratio, using May 2021 data from <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zillow</a>. The PTR ratio is calculated by dividing the median sale price of homes by the median annual rent of homes in a city. The higher the ratio, the better it is to rent a house rather than buy a house in that city.</p>



<p>A low PTR ratio indicates that the costs to rent are similar to the cost to buy property, meaning more renters may make the decision to become homeowners rather than continuing to rent a similar home. A <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-rent-ratio.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high PTR</a> ratio indicates the annual cost of renting a property is considerably less than what it would cost to own. The ratio doesn’t speak to the overall affordability of a property in a particular city, but to the relative costs of renting compared to owning.</p>



<p>Keep reading to discover which markets have the highest PTR ratios in the country and how that might affect real estate investors.</p>

<p>California is an expensive state in which to rent a home, <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/average-rent-by-state" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second only to Hawaii</a>. Cities in the Golden State occupy six slots on this list, so it’s worth considering investing in property in cities with high PTR ratios such as Sacramento. In the past year, home values in the metro area have climbed by more than 24.5%. If that trend continues, investment in the <a href="https://www.zillow.com/sacramento-ca/home-values/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sacramento real estate</a> market could pay off in a big way.</p>

<p>Brigham Young University is located in Provo and has an entrepreneurial spirit as evidenced by the number of <a href="https://thetechtribune.com/7-best-tech-startups-in-provo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech startups</a> in town.
