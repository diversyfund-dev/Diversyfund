<p><b>Arbitration</b></p>
<p>Informal Negotiations. To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof (“Dispute”), you and DiversyFund agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly described below) informally for at least three) days before initiating any arbitration. Such informal negotiations will begin upon written notice from one person to the other. You should send your notice to DiversyFund, Symphony Tower, 750 B Street, Suite 1930 San Diego, CA 92101, ATTENTION: LEGAL DEPARTMENT.  We will send our notice to your address as set forth in the books and records of the Company or by email to the email address provided by you in connection with your use of Services.</p>
<p>Binding Arbitration at Option of Either Party. If you and the Company are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or the Company may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by confidential binding arbitration, and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the <a title="Link to adr.org" href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAA website</a>. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, the Company will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted, at the option of the claimant, either in person or by video conference. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30 days) if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and the Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered and enforcement obtained thereon in any court having jurisdiction. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. Each party shall have the right to participate by video conference in order to minimize travel and expense burdens. Subject to the section of this Agreement titled “Limitations of Liability; Disclaimers”, the arbitrator shall have authority to grant any form of appropriate relief, whether legal or equitable in nature, including specific performance.</p>
<p>No Class Actions. You and the Company agree that any claim brought in connection with a Dispute, whether resolved through arbitration or not, will be brought between the Company and you individually, and that you may not assert any such claim against the Company as plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) no Dispute between you and the Company is to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or will utilize class action procedures; and (3) you may not bring any Dispute in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other users of the Services or any other persons. If this specific provision is determined to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this titled “Arbitration” will be null and void.</p>
<p>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration. You and the Company agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or the Company’s intellectual property rights; and (2) any claim for injunctive relief.</p>
<p>Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement related to its amendment blow, if the Company changes any of the terms of this section on “Arbitration’ after the date you first accepted the Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Agreement), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by electronic mail to legal@diversyfund.com) within 30 days after the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date herein or in the date of the Company’s email to you notifying you of such change (whichever is earlier. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Company in accordance with the terms of this “Arbitration” section as of the date you first accepted the Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Agreement).</p>
